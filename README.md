# Projet-1-Quiz

Quiz Time! An Odyssey Adventure is an exciting web project that I worked on with a group of three other students. It marked my first foray into web development, and we embarked on this adventure just two weeks after our initial class lesson. The quiz, suggested by our instructor, aimed to foster our learning in web development while providing an opportunity to test our knowledge in JavaScript, CSS, and Git.

Key Features:
- Engaging Space Theme: We drew inspiration from the vastness of space and infused the project with captivating visuals and a cosmic atmosphere.
- Multiple Pages: We created different pages, each meticulously designed with CSS, to provide an immersive and dynamic user experience.
- Interactive JavaScript Functionality: Leveraging the power of JavaScript, we implemented interactive features to enhance the quiz gameplay and user interaction.
- Relevant Questions: The quiz questions centered around our weekly lessons, enabling us to reinforce our understanding of JavaScript, CSS, and Git concepts.
- Collaborative Effort: We collaborated as a team, utilizing tools such as Figma for initial design mockups and then bringing our vision to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How well do you know your code?
